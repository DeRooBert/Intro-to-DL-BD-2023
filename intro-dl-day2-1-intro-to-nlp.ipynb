It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the English (or other) language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [\"Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications.

We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better. The Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English, so instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and then use *that* as the base for our classifier.\n\nEven if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of the IMDb dataset, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language than that seen in Wikipedia.\n\nWe already saw that with fastai, we can download a pretrained English language model and use it to get state-of-the-art results for NLP classification. (We expect pretrained models in many more languages to be available soon—they might well be available by the time you are reading this book, in fact.) So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n\nOne reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.\n\nThis is known as the Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFit) approach. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of fine-tuning of the language model, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions.

Sentences can be different lengths, and documents can be very long. So, how can we predict the next word of a sentence using a neural network? Let's find out!\n\nWe've already seen how text can be used with an embedding for a neural network. The approach we will take is:\n\n1. Make a list of all possible tokens in our text (we'll call this list the *vocab*).\n1. Replace each token with its index in the vocab.\n1. Create an embedding matrix for this containing a row for each level (i.e., for each item of the vocab).\n1. Use this embedding matrix as the first layer of a neural network. (A dedicated embedding matrix can take as inputs the raw vocab indexes created in step 2; this is equivalent to but faster and more efficient than a matrix that takes as input one-hot-encoded vectors representing the indexes.)\n\nWhat is missing here is the idea of a sequence. First we concatenate all of the documents in our dataset into one big long string and split it into words, giving us a very long list of words (or \"tokens\"). Our independent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the first word in our very long list and ending with the second to last, and our dependent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the second word and ending with the last word. \n\nOur vocab will consist of a mix of common words that are already in the vocabulary of our pretrained model and new words specific to our corpus (cinematographic terms or actors names, for instance). Our embedding matrix will be built accordingly: for words that are in the vocabulary of our pretrained model, we will take the corresponding row in the embedding matrix of the pretrained model; but for new words we won't have anything, so we will just initialize the corresponding row with a random vector.","metadata":{"id":"Px3GLA0zR2u6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Each of the steps necessary to create a language model has jargon associated with it from the world of natural language processing, and fastai and PyTorch classes available to help.

It also handles some important details, such as how to shuffle the training data in such a way that the dependent and independent variables maintain their structure as required\n- **Language model creation**: We need a special kind of model that does something we haven't seen before: handles input lists which could be arbitrarily big or small. There are a number of ways to do this; in this chapter we will be using a *recurrent neural network* (RNN). We will get to the details of these RNNs later, but for now, you can think of it as just another deep neural network.\n\nLet's take a look at how each step works in detail.","metadata":{"id":"g_Mk2On0R2u8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Tokenization","metadata":{"id":"WjC1jYVoR2u9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When we said \"convert the text into a list of words,\" we left out a lot of details.

Should they be split into their separate pieces of meaning? How about hyphenated words? What about languages like German and Polish where we can create really long words from many, many pieces? What about languages like Japanese and Chinese that don't use bases at all, and don't really have a well-defined idea of *word*?\n\nBecause there is no one correct answer to these questions, there is no one approach to tokenization. There are three main approaches:\n\n- Word-based:: Split a sentence on spaces, as well as applying language-specific rules to try to separate parts of meaning even when there are no spaces (such as turning \"don't\" into \"do n't\"). Generally, punctuation marks are also split into separate tokens.\n- Subword based:: Split words into smaller parts, based on the most commonly occurring substrings. For instance, \"occasion\" might be tokenized as \"o c ca sion.\"\n- Character-based:: Split a sentence into its individual characters.\n\nWe'll be looking at word and subword tokenization here, and we'll leave character-based tokenization for you to implement in the questionnaire at the end of this chapter.","metadata":{"id":"vZM6hjI3R2u-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> jargon: token: One element of a list created by the tokenization process.

By recognizing this start token, the model will be able to learn it needs to \"forget\" what was said previously and focus on upcoming words.\n\nThese special tokens don't come from spaCy directly. They are there because fastai adds them by default, by applying a number of rules when processing text. These rules are designed to make it easier for a model to recognize the important parts of a sentence. In a sense, we are translating the original English language sequence into a simplified tokenized language—a language that is designed to be easy for a model to learn.\n\nFor instance, the rules will replace a sequence of four exclamation points with a special *repeated character* token, followed by the number four, and then a single exclamation point. In this way, the model's embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation rather than requiring a separate token for every number of repetitions of every punctuation mark. Similarly, a capitalized word will be replaced with a special capitalization token, followed by the lowercase version of the word. This way, the embedding matrix only needs the lowercase versions of the words, saving compute and memory resources, but can still learn the concept of capitalization.\n\nHere are some of the main special tokens you'll see:\n\n- `xxbos`:: Indicates the beginning of a text (here, a review)\n- `xxmaj`:: Indicates the next word begins with a capital (since we lowercased everything)\n- `xxunk`:: Indicates the word is unknown\n\nTo see the rules that were used, you can check the default rules:","metadata":{"id":"v_0OwULDR2vQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"defaults.text_proc_rules","metadata":{"id":"CDbRN9EMR2vR","outputId":"080c5d06-fbe5-4c99-e6d6-613453a68079","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As always, you can look at the source code of each of them in a notebook by typing:\n\n```\n??replace_rep\n```\n\nHere is a brief summary of what each does:\n\n- `fix_html`:: Replaces special HTML characters with a readable version (IMDb reviews have quite a few of these)\n- `replace_rep`:: Replaces any character repeated three times or more with a special token for repetition (`xxrep`), the number of times it's repeated, then the character\n- `replace_wrep`:: Replaces any word repeated three times or more with a special token for word repetition (`xxwrep`), the number of times it's repeated, then the word\n- `spec_add_spaces`:: Adds spaces around / and #\n- `rm_useless_spaces`:: Removes all repetitions of the space character\n- `replace_all_caps`:: Lowercases a word written in all caps and adds a special token for all caps (`xxup`) in front of it\n- `replace_maj`:: Lowercases a capitalized word and adds a special token for capitalized (`xxmaj`) in front of it\n- `lowercase`:: Lowercases all text and adds a special token at the beginning (`xxbos`) and/or the end (`xxeos`)","metadata":{"id":"DtNQipX1R2vS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at a few of them in action:","metadata":{"id":"tZK4Lif7R2vU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"coll_repr(tkn('&copy;   Fast.ai www.fast.ai/INDEX'), 31)","metadata":{"id":"8kAM8p3CR2vV","outputId":"a0783c5f-b337-4fbb-d5dd-eb8ec97d2a69","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's take a look at how subword tokenization would work.","metadata":{"id":"BbHQ7qGeR2vX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Subword Tokenization","metadata":{"id":"a_sRNphsR2vZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In addition to the *word tokenization* approach seen in the last section, another popular tokenization method is *subword tokenization*. Word tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However, this assumption is not always appropriate. For instance, consider this sentence: 我的名字是郝杰瑞 (\"My name is Jeremy Howard\" in Chinese). That's not going to work very well with a word tokenizer, because there are no spaces in it! Languages like Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces, and in fact they don't even have a well-defined concept of a \"word.\" There are also languages, like Turkish and Hungarian, that can add many subwords together without spaces, creating very long words that include a lot of separate pieces of information.\n\nTo handle these cases, it's generally best to use subword tokenization. This proceeds in two steps:\n\n1. Analyze a corpus of documents to find the most commonly occurring groups of letters. These become the vocab.\n2.

This means that each new batch should begin precisely where the previous one left off.\n\nSuppose we have the following text:\n\n> : In this chapter, we will go back over the example of classifying movie reviews we studied in chapter 1 and dig deeper under the surface.

As with images, it's best to randomize the order of the inputs, so at the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the entries to make a new stream (we shuffle the order of the documents, not the order of the words inside them, or the texts would not make sense anymore!).\n\nWe then cut this stream into a certain number of batches (which is our *batch size*). For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...), because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in the preceding example). An `xxbos` token is added at the start of each during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\n\nSo to recap, at every epoch we shuffle our collection of documents and concatenate them into a stream of tokens. We then cut that stream into a batch of fixed-size consecutive mini-streams. Our model will then read the mini-streams in order, and thanks to an inner state, it will produce the same activation whatever sequence length we picked.\n\nThis is all done behind the scenes by the fastai library when we create an `LMDataLoader`.

The reason that `TextBlock` is special is that setting up the numericalizer's vocab can take a long time (we have to read and tokenize every document to get the vocab).

This should sound familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we used cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make all the inputs the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!). You can't really \"squish\" a document. So that leaves padding!\n\nWe will expand the shortest texts to make them all the same size. To do this, we use a special padding token that will be ignored by our model. Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend to be of similar lengths. We won't pad every batch to the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch as the target size. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, but at the time of writing no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it. It's something we're planning to add to fastai soon, however, so keep an eye on the book's website; we'll add information about this as soon as we have it working well.)\n\nThe sorting and padding are automatically done by the data block API for us when using a `TextBlock`, with `is_lm=False`.

In <<disinformation>>, the fake comments have been helpfully color-coded by Kao to highlight their formulaic nature.","metadata":{"id":"WyX5BySiR2wy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/images/ethics/image16.png?raw=1\" width=\"700\" id=\"disinformation\" caption=\"Comments received by the FCC during the net neutrality debate\">","metadata":{"id":"Yu60LsPVR2wy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Kao estimated that \"less than 800,000 of the 22M+ comments… could be considered truly unique\" and that \"more than 99% of the truly unique comments were in favor of keeping net neutrality.\"\n\nGiven advances in language modeling that have occurred since 2017, such fraudulent campaigns could be nearly impossible to catch now.  You now have all the necessary tools at your disposal to create a compelling language model—that is, something that can generate context-appropriate, believable text. It won't necessarily be perfectly accurate or correct, but it will be plausible. Think about what this technology would mean when put together with the kinds of disinformation campaigns we have learned about in recent years. Take a look at the Reddit dialogue shown in <<ethics_reddit>>, where a language model based on OpenAI's GPT-2 algorithm is having a conversation with itself about whether the US government should cut defense spending.","metadata":{"id":"QPUqawFiR2wy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/images/ethics/image14.png?raw=1\" id=\"ethics_reddit\" caption=\"An algorithm talking to itself on Reddit\" alt=\"An algorithm talking to itself on Reddit\" width=\"600\">","metadata":{"id":"ToDWbT0NR2wy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this case, it was explicitly said that an algorithm was used, but imagine what would happen if a bad actor decided to release such an algorithm across social networks. They could do it slowly and carefully, allowing the algorithm to gradually develop followers and trust over time. It would not take many resources to have literally millions of accounts doing this. In such a situation we could easily imagine getting to a point where the vast majority of discourse online was from bots, and nobody would have any idea that it was happening.\n\nWe are already starting to see examples of machine learning being used to generate identities.

The problem, however, is that this will always be an arms race, in which better classification (or discriminator) algorithms can be used to create better generation algorithms.","metadata":{"id":"_-iuzUtFR2w1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion","metadata":{"id":"ZlWDxDCUR2w1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this chapter we explored the last application covered out of the box by the fastai library: text. We saw two types of models: language models that can generate texts, and a classifier that determines if a review is positive or negative. To build a state-of-the art classifier, we used a pretrained language model, fine-tuned it to the corpus of our task, then used its body (the encoder) with a new head to do the classification.\n\nBefore we end this section, we'll take a look at how the fastai library can help you assemble your data for your specific problems.","metadata":{"id":"CNg80xeJR2w1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Questionnaire","metadata":{"id":"nFzoa50oR2w2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.
