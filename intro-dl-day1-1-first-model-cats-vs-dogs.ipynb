The first part of the class name will generally be the type of data you have, such as image, or text.\n\nThe other important piece of information that we have to tell fastai is how to get the labels from the dataset. Computer vision datasets are normally structured in such a way that the label for an image is part of the filename, or path—most commonly the parent folder name. fastai comes with a number of standardized labeling methods, and ways to write your own. Here we're telling fastai to use the `is_cat` function we just defined.\n\nFinally, we define the `Transform`s that we need. A `Transform` contains code that is applied automatically during training; fastai includes many predefined `Transform`s, and adding new ones is as simple as creating a Python function. There are two kinds: `item_tfms` are applied to each item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224-pixel square), while `batch_tfms` are applied to a *batch* of items at a time using the GPU, so they're particularly fast (we'll see many examples of these throughout this course).\n\nWhy 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything. If you increase the size, you'll often get a model with better results (since it will be able to focus on more details), but at the price of speed and memory consumption; the opposite is true if you decrease the size. \n\nThe most important parameter to mention here is `valid_pct=0.2`. This tells fastai to hold out 20% of the data and *not use it for training the model at all*. This 20% of the data is called the *validation set*; the remaining 80% is called the *training set*. The validation set is used to measure the accuracy of the model. By default, the 20% that is held out is selected randomly. The parameter `seed=42` sets the *random seed* to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it—this way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set.\n\nfastai will *always* show you your model's accuracy using *only* the validation set, *never* the training set. This is absolutely critical, because if you train a large enough model for a long enough time, it will eventually memorize the label of every item in your dataset! The result will not actually be a useful model, because what we care about is how well our model works on *previously unseen images*. That is always our goal when creating a model: for it to be useful on data that the model only sees in the future, after it has been trained.\n\nEven when your model has not fully memorized all your data, earlier on in training it may have memorized certain parts of it. As a result, the longer you train for, the better your accuracy will get on the training set; the validation set accuracy will also improve for a while, but eventually it will start getting worse as the model starts to memorize the training set, rather than finding generalizable underlying patterns in the data. When this happens, we say that the model is *overfitting*.","metadata":{"id":"jYfmrzpENo5T","papermill":{"duration":0.028957,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:31.254308","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:31.225351","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can then check if everything looks okay with the `show_batch` method (`True` is for cat, `False` is for dog):","metadata":{"id":"Q2piUkrqOGzS","papermill":{"duration":0.028709,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:31.313195","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:31.284486","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dls.show_batch()","metadata":{"id":"LVPFQgAaNoSn","outputId":"fbcc5fbd-211c-4805-9013-1d4083dde8c9","papermill":{"duration":1.091551,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:32.433417","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:31.341866","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-15T08:32:28.642173Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-15T08:32:28.642793Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-15T08:32:30.121919Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-15T08:32:28.642736Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-15T08:32:30.121035Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The fifth line of the code training our image recognizer tells fastai to create a *convolutional neural network* (CNN) and specifies what *architecture* to use (i.e. what kind of model to create), what data we want to train it on, and what *metric* to use:\n\n```python\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\n```\n\nWhy a CNN? It's the current state-of-the-art approach to creating computer vision models. \n\nThere are many different architectures in fastai. Most of the time, however, picking an architecture isn't a very important part of the deep learning process. It's something that academics love to talk about, but in practice it is unlikely to be something you need to spend much time on. There are some standard architectures that work most of the time, and in this case we're using one called _ResNet_ that we'll be talking a lot about during the course; it is both fast and accurate for many datasets and problems. The `34` in `resnet34` refers to the number of layers in this variant of the architecture (other options are `18`, `50`, `101`, and `152`). Models using architectures with more layers take longer to train, and are more prone to overfitting (i.e. you can't train them for as many epochs before the accuracy on the validation set starts getting worse). On the other hand, when using more data, they can be quite a bit more accurate.","metadata":{"id":"IaKpzpc6Oa9D","papermill":{"duration":0.040142,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:32.513818","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:32.473676","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`cnn_learner` also has a parameter `pretrained`, which defaults to `True` (so it's used in this case, even though we haven't specified it), which sets the weights in your model to values that have already been trained by experts to recognize a thousand different categories across 1.3 million photos (using the famous [*ImageNet* dataset](http://www.image-net.org/)). A model that has weights that have already been trained on some other dataset is called a *pretrained model*. You should nearly always use a pretrained model, because it means that your model, before you've even shown it any of your data, is already very capable. And, as you'll see, in a deep learning model many of these capabilities are things you'll need, almost regardless of the details of your project. For instance, parts of pretrained models will handle edge, gradient, and color detection, which are needed for many tasks.\n\nWhen using a pretrained model, `cnn_learner` will remove the last layer, since that is always specifically customized to the original training task (i.e. ImageNet dataset classification), and replace it with one or more new layers with randomized weights, of an appropriate size for the dataset you are working with. This last part of the model is known as the *head*.\n\nUsing pretrained models is the *most* important method we have to allow us to train more accurate models, more quickly, with less data, and less time and money. Using a pretrained model for a task different to what it was originally trained for is known as *transfer learning*. Unfortunately, because transfer learning is so under-studied, few domains have pretrained models available.

In order to fit a model, we have to provide at least one piece of information: how many times to look at each image (known as number of *epochs*). The number of epochs you select will largely depend on how much time you have available, and how long you find it takes in practice to fit your model. If you select a number that is too small, you can always train for more epochs later.\n\nBut why is the method called `fine_tune`, and not `fit`? fastai actually *does* have a method called `fit`, which does indeed fit a model (i.e. look at images in the training set multiple times, each time updating the parameters to make the predictions closer and closer to the target labels).

This is important, because otherwise you would have to redefine how to transform your data in order to use your model in production. fastai automatically uses your validation set `DataLoader` for inference by default, so your data augmentation will not be applied, which is generally what you want.\n\nWhen you call `export`, fastai will save a file called \"export.pkl\":","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.04025,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:32.833618","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:32.793368","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.export('/kaggle/working/export.pkl')","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.216367,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:33.090048","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:32.873681","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-15T08:32:33.865738Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-15T08:32:33.866363Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-15T08:32:34.041801Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-15T08:32:33.866325Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-15T08:32:34.040767Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's check that the file exists, by using the `ls` method that fastai adds to Python's `Path` class:","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.039158,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:33.169018","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:33.129860","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"path = Path('/kaggle/working')\npath.ls(file_exts='.pkl')","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.050232,"end_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:33.258610","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-27T16:00:33.208378","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-15T08:32:35.978812Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-15T08:32:35.979971Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-15T08:32:35.987698Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-15T08:32:35.979921Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-15T08:32:35.986571Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the Kaggle notebooks you will notice that there is a third option in the “Add Data” modal: Notebook Output Files.\n\nUp to 20 GBs of output from a Notebook may be saved to disk in /kaggle/working.

As you can see, the model is nearly perfect, even though the training time was only a few minutes (not including the one-time downloading of the dataset and the pretrained model).
