The goal is to classify petri-dishes based on the fact that the bacteria in the petri plate did grow or not. The data is coming from a research paper [MicrobIA Images Dataset (Beta ver. 0.1) ](http://www.microbia.org/index.php/resources). We already cropped the images to a size of 512 x 512 pixels and put them in training, validation and testing folders with sub-folders Growth and NoGrowth (except for the test set which you need to provide labels for).\n\nThe goal for you is to achieve the highest prediction performance as possible. This performance will be assessed based on the [cohen kappa score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score.html) on the test set predictions. You have until the end of the day to try some models and the one that at 5pm has the highest score wins !\n## Dataset preparation\nYou can import the data from the [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/t/46cf32e75219429cb8d866056ec5b285)","metadata":{"id":"lT5OgXaJ3_Yn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!ls ../input/intro-to-dl-bacterial-growth/data_blind #check the contents of our vm","metadata":{"id":"FJ5QzwZGFDe6","outputId":"44a89d8f-8e76-49f4-992f-ac684bb9bfed","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1539158465229,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":9242,"user":{"displayName":"thomas.dekelver@skynet.be","photoUrl":"","userId":"11278612312403579383"}},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-25T12:53:32.077807Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-25T12:53:32.0782Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-25T12:53:32.843583Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-25T12:53:32.078148Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-25T12:53:32.842204Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#check number of images we have\n!ls ../input/intro-to-dl-bacterial-growth/data_blind/train/NoGrowth | wc -l #number training images of negative class\n!ls ../input/intro-to-dl-bacterial-growth/data_blind/train/Growth | wc -l #number training images of positive class","metadata":{"id":"zu_Pz5z86UtE","outputId":"a607e0b0-ab5e-4fe8-8c17-19cf283de311","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1539158488120,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":9877,"user":{"displayName":"thomas.dekelver@skynet.be","photoUrl":"","userId":"11278612312403579383"}},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-25T12:53:40.922551Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-25T12:53:40.92357Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-25T12:53:42.622722Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-25T12:53:40.923523Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-25T12:53:42.621466Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!ls -U ../input/intro-to-dl-bacterial-growth/data_blind/train/Growth | head -10 #check name of first 10 images","metadata":{"id":"67pSW8DuAgDl","outputId":"53ba65e7-9f0b-45e0-ccc8-c4d84b42c292","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1539158531736,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5534,"user":{"displayName":"thomas.dekelver@skynet.be","photoUrl":"","userId":"11278612312403579383"}},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-25T12:53:42.629761Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-25T12:53:42.630594Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-25T12:53:43.60623Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-25T12:53:42.630519Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-25T12:53:43.605382Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Start playing\nThe rest is up to you!\n\nGood luck !","metadata":{"id":"oYl4YjLt1eLW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
